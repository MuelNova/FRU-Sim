# v1.5.4
- DD: Added support for Mami (EU) and Vertical Spread (JP) strats. Needs testing.
- DD: Bots will now always move towards mid while tank is baiting jump. Cleaned up tank movement.
- P4: Increased size of Fragment of Fate hitbox. Need more research/vods showing the exact size of their hitbox.
- CT: Adjusted post-rewind spread positions.
- Apoc: Added option to force swap the player. It does so by giving them the same Water timer as the lowest adjust prio in their group.
- Apoc: Fixed Darkest Dance AoE hit to snapshot on the farthest player's position at the end of the cast. Note that in game, this ability does not line up well with its animation. This change should better reflect its actual timing, but may still need some adjusting.
- Apoc: Fixed bug where tank did not bait Darkest Dance out far enough.
- Apoc: Increased Water AoE size.
- UR: Added missing Return debuff, which should accurately count down until Rewind Stun is applied.
- General: Fixed bug with players getting stuck after rewind or knockback.

# v1.6.0
- Added P5 Fulgent Blade mechanic. Rest of P5 to be added later.
- Apoc: Moved Darkest Dance AoE hit earlier, to better line up with when it snapshots in game.
- LR: Added Mana DC positioning (Credit to WaterBoiledPizza). Will add waymark preset for Mana later.
- General: Added Reset keybind ('R' by default).
- General: Debuff timers should now appear and expire more accurately.

# v1.6.1
- DD: Added support for Mana and MUR Strats (Credit to WaterBoiledPizza and Ducky).
- DD: Added more options for Darkest Dance and Akh Morn tank assignments.
- DD+LR: Added fail condition for stretching chains too close or too far.
- DD+CT: Added option to force Spirit Taker jump on player.
- CT: Reduced size of the Dragon Head's hitbox and moved it farther in front of the model. This may need further tweaking but the goal is to replicate the jankiness of soaking these in game.
- CT: Added support for MUR lineup prio and Aeros Plant option (Credit to Ducky).
- CT: Added 7-1 Akh Morn option.
- CT+UR: Added option to hide bots.
- CT: Added missing Rewind debuff.
- CT: Fixed issue where M1 was baiting Spirit Jump too close to the Fragment.
- General: Improved waymark visual (Credit to WorstAquaPlayer)
- General: Fixed most debuff icon tooltips.


## v1.7.0
# New Additions (need testing):
- Added Paradise Regained and Polarizing Strikes to Phase 5 (Pandora). You can select either of these or Fulgent Blade as a starting point, or practice all 3 in sequence. Currently this only supports the NAUR/LPDU/MUR strat (https://slides.com/ultiproject/frup5/scroll).
- Added Mana DC strat support for Apoc. Credit to WaterBoiledPizza.

# UI Changes:
- Improved Party List visuals.
- Party List can now be reordered, with the option to keep player at top of list.
- Most UI Elements can now be moved (Alt+Click) and resized (Alt+ScrollWheel). This can be rebound in control settings. Credit to WorstAquaPlayer.
- Window should now keep its position on reset, rather than resetting to center of screen.

# Fixes:
- UR: Fixed incorrect movements and debuffs for Med Fires on Grey-9 strat.
- Darklit: Force Tether button should now work.

# Known Issues:
- Changing window size/resolution can sometimes push UI elements off the screen. If this happens, use the Reset UI button that appears at the top left while holding Alt.
- The Pandora model is unavailable due to datamine protected. If that changes in 7.2, I'll update the P5 model.
